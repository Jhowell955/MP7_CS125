Volume of N-th Dimensional Ball Calculator
Implements a Monte Carlo simulation for calculating the volume of an ball in N dimensions with radius 1.
Allows user to input a specified number of random points to generate and what the value of N should be.
User can also choose to input a density to calculate the ball's mass.
